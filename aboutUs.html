    <h3 class="aboutUsTitle">Welcome to Wolfes BBQ – A True Taste of Kokomo</h3>
    <p>Founded in 2023, Wolfes BBQ is more than just a place to eat—it’s a homegrown gathering spot where friends, families, and food lovers come together to enjoy authentic, handcrafted barbecue made the old-fashioned way.
    Nestled right here in Kokomo, Indiana, Wolfes stands as a proud local favorite built on tradition, flavor, and community.</p>
     
     <p>From the moment you walk through the door, you’ll notice the warmth of a true
       hometown joint—smiling faces, the smell of hickory smoke drifting from the pit, and
        a menu crafted with care. Every rib, brisket slice, pulled pork sandwich, and smoked
         sausage link is prepared low and slow, honoring the time-tested methods that make
          real barbecue unforgettable.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Wolfes, we’re committed to quality from start to finish. We never use frozen meat—ever.
        Every cut that goes into our smokers is fresh, inspected, and handled with the same attention to detail you’d expect from a pitmaster who takes pride in the craft.
        Ensuring everything is fresh isn’t just a promise—it’s part of our daily routine, from our sourcing to our prep work, to the final plate you enjoy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our barbecue style is uniquely ours—an evolving craft shaped by years of experience working in smokehouses and restaurants across the country.
        Drawing inspiration from the bold, pepper-forward flavors of Texas brisket, the rich, tender pork traditions of Tennessee, and the techniques learned through every kitchen along the way, we’ve created something truly original. 
        This fusion of influences has grown into what many of our guests proudly call “Indiana-style” BBQ—a flavor profile rooted in Midwest heart but elevated by the best traditions of the South.
      </p>

      <p>Whether you’re grabbing lunch with coworkers, celebrating with family, or just craving
      that perfect bite of smoky, savory goodness, Wolfes BBQ is your place to relax, indulge, and
      feel at home. We believe great barbecue brings people together—and that’s exactly what we’re 
      here to do.</p>
